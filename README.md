**************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3: 
• We want you to automate the deployment of a simple web application (e.g. WordPress site) in a cloud provider of your choice. We would like to see 
the infrastructure choices you have provisioned to host such application using IaC of your choice and the way you automate the deployment of both 
your infrastructure and application. Make some notes on how you would further “Productionise” such solution.
• Brownie points if the application is running.
Please commit your notebook to GitHub and share the repo path with your recruitment contact.
